# miles GRPO Training — Qwen3-4B on HyperPod EKS
#
# Submits a Ray job that runs GRPO with Megatron-LM for training and SGLang for
# rollout. COLOCATE picks how the two share the cluster, and with it how weights
# reach the rollout engines after every training step:
#
#   COLOCATE=true   one GPU pool, time-shared. Weights move by CUDA IPC.
#   COLOCATE=false  two GPU pools. Weights move by NCCL broadcast, over EFA when
#                   the pools are on different nodes.
#
# Both layouts are exercised by this recipe; see the COLOCATE block below for the
# sizing rules each one imposes.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Ray cluster deployed via kubernetes/raycluster.yaml
#   - Model downloaded and converted to torch_dist format
#   - Training data on FSx
#   - source env_vars before running
#
# Usage:
#   source env_vars
#   bash recipe/run_grpo_qwen3_4b.sh
